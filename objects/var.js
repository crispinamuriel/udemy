//legacy code
//let , const, var
//why let const ? var is less than ideal
//Var is similar to let , we can reassign its value

// var firstName = 'Jenn'

// firstName = 'Mike'

// var firstName = 'Andrew'

// console.log(firstName)

//var / const / let

//let and const will crash when you create variables that are already created
//next reason var is function scoped not blocked scoped

// if (10 === 10){
//     let firstName = 'Jen'
// }

// console.log(firstName)

// //blocked scoped variables will give fine grained control over the scope

// const setName = function (){
//     var firstName = 'Jen'
// }

// setName()


console.log(age)

var age = 10

//if we try to access a var variable before it's defined it will be hoisted to the top
