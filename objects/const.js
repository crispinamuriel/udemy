//cannot reassign the value of a const defining it
//lots of situations where we are trying to create a variable that we DO NOT want to reassign it
//can manipulate the values inside of an object

//Code readability, 2 ways to describe a variable 
//constant tells others that this is a variable whos value will never change
//provides clear semantics that the let variable may changed somewhere down the line in the program

//objects allow us to modle things in the real word and allow us to store infromation that is related

//the array allows us to store list based data, list of emails users data
